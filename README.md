# Coexistence and diversity in a consumer resource model with a serial dilution setting
The coexistence of species and maintenance of diversity is the most important
question in Ecology. Consumer resources models are one of the most interesting
settings to model microbial ecosystems. The great majority of theoretical studies
have been framed in the chemostat setting, where resources are constantly flowing
through the system. On the other hand, both experiments and natural communities,
like the gut microbiome, are better described as serial dilution processes,
where resources are periodically replenished and consumed. Surprisingly, in this
case theoretical results are scarce. The main goal of this thesis is to fill this gap.
We study a general multispecies consumer resource model in serial dilution using
both numerical tools and analytical techniques borrowed from disordered statistical
physics. We find that under general conditions the number of coexisting species
is lower than the chemostat setting. Furthermore, both the timescales to reach a
stationary state and the shape of the species abundances distribution appear to
depend dramatically on the connectivity properties of the consumption matrix:
while for a fully connected model the system shows enormously long transients,
by introducing a small sparsity such timescales reduce abruptly. We developed a
novel algorithm to face this problem of long time scales for the convergence of the
process.
